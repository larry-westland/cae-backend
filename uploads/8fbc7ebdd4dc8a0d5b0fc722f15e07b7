9,C,Safe decommissioning of Mooring and Anchoring system,"The Mooring and Anchoring system will be designed with consideration given to future decommissioning activities, such that this can take place safely with the risk exposure to people reduced ALARP.",D,Mooring & Anchoring,Working in Confined Spaces,,,,
,A,Residual risk of working in confined spaces,The residual risk of personnel working at height during decommissioning of the Mooring and Anchoring system has been reduced ALARP through the development of the overall wind farm construction strategy.,D,Mooring & Anchoring,Working in Confined Spaces,,,,
,E,Reduce need for divers,"The need for divers has been removed where possibe, replaced with ROVs, and if absolutely necessary has been planned and risk assessed.",D,Mooring & Anchoring,Working in Confined Spaces,,,,
,E,Mooring cables and Anchoring points left in situ,"The Mooring cables and Anchoring points will be left in situ in the seabed after decommissioning of the wind farm, eliminating the need to conduct removal operations.",D,Mooring & Anchoring,Working in Confined Spaces,,,,
